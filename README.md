# Dark Pomodoro

A minimalistic Pomodoro timer.
The goal is to provide a distraction-free and easy-to-use Pomodoro timer.
Made for me to practice Svelte and SvelteKit

# To-Do

- Features related to authentication and user data (the current sign in button doesn't do anything meaningful)
- Shared timer sessions
- More database logic and saved sessions

# Demo
